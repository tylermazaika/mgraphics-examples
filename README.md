# Image Upscaling

Demonstrates usage of Image that looks good on both Low and High DPI displays by using upscaling.

Open the "Image Upscaling" Max Project and view the patch on both Low and High DPI displays to see the rendering differences between:
- Image at 1x (normal) scale.
- Image at 2x upscale.
- The same drawing code drawn directly to the screen.
